# Multitabs
Coming soon...

## Module
There are 2 approaches to create multitabs:
<ul>
	<li>Create a Div independent of individual tabs (One Div-approach)</li>
	<li>Create a Div along with all individual tabs (MultiDiv-approach)</li>
</ul>

With the first approach, it allows the code to be more dynamic, flexible and robust without declare each a Div in each tab. With the second approach, it allows you to have Div's more customized layout under each tab and without loading every time switching back and forth between tabs.
