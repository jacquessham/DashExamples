# Multitabs
Multi-tabs module allows users to display the dashboard on the selected category in the dashboard. There are two approaches and this folder includes the modules with both approaches.

## Module
There are 2 approaches to create multitabs:
<ul>
	<li>Create a Div independent of individual tabs (One Div-approach)</li>
	<li>Create a Div along with all individual tabs (MultiDiv-approach)</li>
</ul>

With the first approach, it allows the code to be more dynamic, flexible and robust without declare each a Div in each tab. With the second approach, it allows you to have Div's more customized layout under each tab and without loading every time switching back and forth between tabs.

### One Div-Approach
The module allows user to select the tab. The visualization is independent from the tab so it will trigger and re-generate the visualization when a tab is selected.
